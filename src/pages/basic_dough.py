    ### Hydration
    The lower the hydration, the drier the dough. The dried the dough, the crispier the base. The wetter the dough, the lighter and chewier the base.
    50% would be very dry. 65% is a good middle ground. 

    ### Preparation
    

    ### Resting time
    The longer the dough rests, the softer the raw flour becomes and the easier it becomes to digest.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Use strong flour (W 280-330) and non-iodised salt. See _W Index_ for more details.
