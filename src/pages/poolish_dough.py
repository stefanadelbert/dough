    ### Preferment (Poolish)
    - flour and water
    - 3g dry yeast
    - tsp honey (optional)
    Mix water, yeast and honey and leave for 5mins. If it's foaming, your yeast is active, but if not try again with other yeast.
    Stir in flour so that all flour is wet. Cover (cling film + tea towel) and leave at room temp for 1hr. Fridge 8-16hrs - this is what makes all the difference!

    ### Bulk ferment
    Mix (gently) water with poolish and put aside. Mix salt (2-3% of total flour mass) with flour (whisk is good). Now put it all together and combine well.
    Stretch and fold several times at half hour intervals. Use water on your hands and work quickly to avoid the dough sticking. It'll be SUPER wet and sticky.
    This dough should rest for a few hours (2hrs).

    ### Shape
    Divide into dough balls and let them rest (1hr).

    ‚ö†Ô∏è Use strong flour (W 280-330) and non-iodised salt. See _W Index_ for more details.
